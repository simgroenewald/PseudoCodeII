# PseudoCodeII
Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 2
Compulsory Task
Follow these steps:
● Create a new text file called algorithms.txt inside this folder.
● Inside algorithms.txt , write pseudocode for the following scenarios:
○ An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
World”.
○ An algorithm that asks a user to enter their age and then stores
their age in a variable called age. Subsequently, the algorithm
should print out “You’re old enough” if the user’s age is over or
equal to 18, or print out “Almost there” if the age is equal to or over
16, but less than 18. Finally, the algorithm should print out “You’re
just too young” if the user is younger than (and not equal to) 16.
